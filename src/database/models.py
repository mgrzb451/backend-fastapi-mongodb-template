'''Remember that unlike with SQL we're using these models for both request and response data validation. Gotta think which model will be applicable in each scenario. E.g. Student class we use in a response so we'll get an "_id" in the ObjectId format from Mongo - that's why we have to use the `Annotated[str, BeforeValidator(str)]` construct to convert it into a string first
But in the case of StudentUpdate which we use to validate the request we will get the id from the frontend in the form of a string, so we don't have to convert into a string. Just a small optimization ðŸ˜‰'''
