# mongo-project-explorer
A template project for use with my notes showing what I arrived at after a loooooooong and arduous process of figuring out the best way to work with FastAPI and MongoDB in an asynchronous manner.

I used the built-in async functionality in the Pymongo 4+ version rather than Motor. I tried to incorporate as many good, modern practices as I could in regards to Pydantic and FastAPI practices. I discovered many improvements I can add in future projects.

Now that I have a base to work from I'll move on to more backend functionality. Up next **Authentication**. _OAuth2_ and *JWT* here I come! ðŸ˜ƒ
